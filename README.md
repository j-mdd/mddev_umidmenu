for support to any of my script or QBCore in main [Discord Support](https://discord.gg/5BhmYRHmbU)



there is id-card , driverlicense and weapon license to add more with custom price you have to follow the same thing that are followed in all events in server side / server.lua
and there is an Notify event in client you can trigger it one for error and one primary.

You can edit everything in Config.lua

just edit the mddev_umidmenu Config.lua to make it ready on your RP Server !

Good luck
