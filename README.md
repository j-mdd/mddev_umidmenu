it's ready to work in RP Server and its fully configurable and detailed config
for support to any of my script or QBCore in main : https://discord.gg/5BhmYRHmbU



there is id-card , driverlicense and weapon license to add more with custom price you have to follow the same thing that are followed in all events in server side / server.lua
and there is an Notify event in client you can trigger it one for error and one primary.

You can edit everything in Config.lua

Good luck
